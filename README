TODO

- With the refactoring I am now getting these warnings: "PerformSelector may cause 
  a leak because its selector is unknown"
- When we don't have the right number of operands, consider going into an "error mode"
  and displaying a red "E" or something like that.  Now it just assumes zero and runs
  with that, which is a little presumptuous.
- Same with divide-by-zero case.  Currently just evals to zero.  Infinity makes more
  sense, error makes even more sense.
