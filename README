Dumb little RPN calculator, learning project for CS 193P, taught by Paul 
Hegarty.  Don't try to use for anything useful.  Not well tested.

TODO

- Get the calculator to show up as a popover when in iPad portrait
  mode.  
- With the refactoring I am now getting these warnings: 
  "PerformSelector may cause a leak because its selector is unknown"
- Not sure if saving/loading defaults is actually working.  How to
  test, debugger seems to get confused
- When we don't have the right number of operands, consider going
  into an "error mode" and displaying a red "E" or something like 
  that.  Now it just assumes zero and runs with that, which is a 
  little presumptuous.
- Same with divide-by-zero case.  Currently just evals to zero.
  Infinity makes more sense, error makes even more sense.
